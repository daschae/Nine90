Nine90
================================================================================

An iOS static library to house some UI enhancements used in projects that I currently work on. A sample project [Nine90Sample] (https://github.com/daschae/Nine90Sample) is available that demonstrates its use.

*NOTE* The simplest way to use [Nine90] (https://github.com/daschae/Nine90) is to add it to your current project's workspace.

Components
----------

The following components are currently available. I'll add more as time allows.

*   N90SelectControl (iPhone only) -- A drop down control implemented via a slide up picker similar to MobileSafari's implementation of a select element on iOS. This component currently only supports portrait orientation.
    
TODO
----

*   Enhance N90SelectControl to support landscape orientation.
*   Enhance N90SelectControl to support the iPad to match MobileSafari's behavior there as well.
*   Develop additional components.
